<p>Mike Terry</p>
<p>This is the original concrete guy. He has been doing concrete on his own since 1971 throughout the Utah County area. He has experience in just about every situation involving concrete. His main concern is that your concrete job is completed in a timely manner with quality and durability that you can appreciate for years to come. He also has an architectural eye, so he likes to design.</p>
